Unfortunately [shutter][1] does no longer work (or not yet, maybe, hopefully ðŸ˜‰ with Wayland on Arch. But I still use it for image editing, namely screenshot annotations, for which this is the best tool by far I have ever found. Not to mention the most private one, cause everybody and his dog wants you to upload "to the cloud" nowadays.

On a freshly installed system you will find the "Edit" button grayed out though after you installed Shutter. Reason being there's a lib missing which is not installed by default. This is how you install it:

```default
$ yaourt -S perl-goo-canvas
```

And the editing continues.
