Just a collection of links, cause this is something which is not really documented in full. I am also too lazy, but next time I don't want to search ðŸ™‚ .

  * Basic installation instructions: [3rd party article][1] (German), [Arch Linux docs][2] (without LUKS)
      * _Read the comments_ on the first article: gummiboot is now [bootctl][3], you have to format the boot partition with FAT32, and you should use a better random generator on cryptsetup. It's all in there.
      * **Note:** The former /boot partition **is identical to** the UEFI boot partition. You don't need both.
  * Arch Linux original instructions: [In German][4], [in English][5]
      * **Careful:** The setting "FONT_MAP" in /etc/vconsole.conf in theÂ _German_ guide shouldÂ **not** be applied! It's obsolete.
      * The English guide does only go into the crypt installation, but that really deep.
  * If you actually added FONT_MAP to /etc/vconsole.conf, [that happens][6]
  * The file /vmlinuz-linux [comes in the "kernel" package][7]. If it's missing, just reinstall "pacman -S kernel"
  * You can usually choose between NetworkManager and systemd-networkd as networking management solutions. I chose NetworkManager:
      * systemctl enable NetworkManager
      * systemctl start NetworkManager
      * systemctl disable systemd-networkd
      * systemctl disable systemd-resolved
  * [Installing GNOME][8] (and the login manager gdm) is pretty simple:
      * pacman -S gnome gnome-extras
      * systemctl enable gdm

That should be it.
