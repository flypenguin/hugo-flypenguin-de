Not sure how I could have lived without this until now (had it before in Sublime, never bothered porting, stooooopid as I realize now ðŸ˜‰ ):

```
'.source.puppet':
  'Puppet: fail inline template':
    'prefix': 'fit'
    'body': """
      $fail_me = inline_template('<%= require "yaml"; YAML.dump(@$1) %>')
      fail("\\\\n\\\\nVariable \\\\$$1:\\\\n\${fail_me}\\\\n\\\\n")
    """
```
