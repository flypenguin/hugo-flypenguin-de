You just have to write about something, and it changes. In this case, that's pretty good üôÇ . So here's a list of APIs and data sources for the CoV-2 pandemia.

APIs:

  * <https://covid19api.com/> - the name says it all. Explicitly free.
    Data source: Johns Hopkins University
  * <https://coronavirus-tracker-api.herokuapp.com/> - an API for the numbers, includes history.
    Data source: unknown.
  * <https://corona-stats.online/> - another (somewhat strange) API.
    Data source: worldometers.info (default), Johns Hopkins University (optional)

Data sources:

  * [The Humanitarian Data Exchange's COVID-19 case data][1]
    No idea where this data comes from, but it's the only machine-readable data source I found.
  * [COVID survival calculator][2] (added 2020-04-01)
    almost 5 MB dataset of unknown origin, including links to other sources
  * [Our World in Data][3] (added 2020-04-01)
    another dataset
  *  [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control][4]
    Daily data tables for download in various formats
  * [Johns Hopkins Data on GitHub][5]
  * [A dataset on Kaggle][6]
    Although I think for downloading you need an account

Dashboards and visualizations:

  * [Information is Beautiful][7] (added 2020-04-04)
  * [Datawrapper.de][8] (added 2020-04-04)
  * [1point3acres.com][9] (US only, added 2020-04-04)
  * [**A _lot_ of user kernels on Kaggle**][10] (added 2020-04-04)
    Jupyter & R notebooks you can fool around with yourself!
