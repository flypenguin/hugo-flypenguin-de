This is a list of popular coding fonts. My personal favorites are marked in bold.

As for "why" ... **Consolas** and **Menlo** are just super smooth. Right weight / height / spacing / proportions. You can "just work" with them and it's never wrong. At the moment I think **JetBrains Mono** is just _this tiny bit_ better, even if only for the ligatures.

Honorable mentions go to **Iosevka**, which is a bit strange, but very narrow so you can fit a lot in the available screen width.

The rest is not bad, I just keep circling back to one of the mentioned alternatives within minutes usually. Personal style might differ.

  * [**Consolas**][1] **- Windows proprietary.**
  * **Menlo - Mac proprietary.**
  * **<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/lp/mono/" rel="nofollow">Jetbrains Mono</a> - brew cask: `font-jetbrains-mono`**
