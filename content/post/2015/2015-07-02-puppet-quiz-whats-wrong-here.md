The error is: Dependency cycle.

The code is:

<pre>class my::own::docker {
    include ::docker
    file { '/var/lib/docker':
        ensure =&gt; directory,
        before =&gt; Class['docker'],
    }
}</pre>

Why? ðŸ™‚

It's rather simple here, in the real class it really took me a while to find it.
