Filed my first LibreOffice bugs. And I must say: A free and open source word processor with an open doucment format is desperately needed, but one that actually works. LibreOffice is really ... well, bad looking and playing catch-up with "the other", and crashing really way too often for my taste.

And while working with a lot of tables (which is a pain in the ass with LO) I found three bugs. And on one bug even the LO team agrees that it's a major one ðŸ™‚ .

To be honest, I think the autoformat was never really used by anyone, it's that crappy.

[Custom table autoformat ignores background colors under certain circumstances][1]  
[Font STYLES for Table Headers are not copied when defining auto table format][2]  
[Table Autoformat: Allow to select if "SUM" line is present for auto format][3]
