Well, after the Firefox Essentials, here's my list of Mac essentials:

  * [LaunchBar][1]
  * [Homebrew][2]
  * [Firefox Beta][3]
  * [Exact Scan Pro][4] (scanner utilities for Mac are still ... all bad, this is absolutely good and relatively the best. [VueScan][5] might be better for about 0.05% of all scans I do, but the usability could actually not be any worse)
  * [The Unarchiver][6]
  * [Sublime Text][7], or probably in the future [Atom][8] (text editors)
  * [Cubby][9] and [Bittorrent Sync][10] (document sync, don't really like Dropbox)
  * [VLC player][11]
  * [Better Snap Tool][12] (yah, don't really get the split screen of OS X)
  * [PDF Expert][13] or [PDF Pen Pro][14] (both good, the first is way cheaper, and the reason is that Preview can actually make PDF files bigger on edits like remove pages, or rearrange pages)
  * [Amphetamine][15] (keep your Mac awake)
  * [Typinator][16] (text epansion)
  * [Twitter client][17] (I actually use the official one)
  * [Libre Office][18]
  * [Telegram][19] (useful Whatsapp alternative, cause it also has a web interface)
  * [Path Finder][20]
  * [Shimo][21] (VPN client, really expensive, but "use this password for all connections in this folder" is awesome)
  * [Hazel][22]
