... can be seen on the [Firefox Addons page as collection][1] ðŸ™‚ .

The addon ecosystem of Firefox is what keeps me with it. And the way it's done. One example: Mouse Gestures _are_ available on Chrome, which seems to be a lot faster and smoother today :'( ... but in FF, when I go to the settings page, I can _still_ use mouse gestures, cause it's just another page.

In Chrome I can't. I like the Firefox behavior - it's _consistent_, which is highly a highly underrated property these days.
